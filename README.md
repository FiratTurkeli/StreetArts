Developed interactive and responsive front-end mobile application using Dart Programming Language, those were also shaped with Flutter Material and Cupertino styling tools 

## Getting Started

Proven capabilities to work with Android Studio, well-equipped in theory and in practice
Backend phase of the completed projects, were developed by using Google Firebase/Firestore platform to provide user authentication, registration, login, models and other database operations to these apps. A medium-sized project with ease of use using Provider.
It was created on the idea of supporting street artists and increasing their recognition
Experienced in scalable and reusable codes, using libraries, tools and packages,
The frontend section has Cupertino tab bar, Google Maps, and search page. A Modal Sheet showing profile information and a drawer showing our options are helpful. Card structures that can be swiped right and down, detailed page views. 
Researching and considering until solved, any studying and coding challenges that have been encountered during developing phase.
